The beginning of traditional English learning is relatively easy as there are only 26 letters in English, but it takes a lot of time to master. At the same time, with the increase of new vocabulary, the English word combination is more and more. According to incomplete statistics, the words used in the world currently are nearly one million and they are still increasing. So people have to learn new words constantly and the cost of learning for people who are not native speakers of English is very high.

However, the feature of Chinese is that the total number of words is limited and only about 4,000 words are commonly used. If one can master all basic words in Chinese, then all new words can be learned by composing of the original basic words in Chinese. It makes that the cost is higher for beginners but will be lower for using it in the future. 

Both oriental language and Western language have their own characteristics, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.If the advantages of the two languages are combined together, created a new language system on the original basis, it will play a huge role in the cultural exchange of human beings.

Why is it called "International Simplified English"? Because English has become a major language of human cultural exchange in the world, it is inopportune to create a new language to replace English. But the drawbacks of English are more and more obvious, it is time to be optimized. Simplified English is a language with simplified rules and usage compared with traditional international English. It is also the same as simplified Chinese. The language combined by both simplified English and Chinese is called "International Simplified English" popularized for internationalization.
